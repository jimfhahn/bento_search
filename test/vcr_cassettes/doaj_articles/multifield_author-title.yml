        "This paper is based on the author\u2019s contribution to \u2018The Research
        Agenda for the Left Today\u2019 panel held during the Society for Socialist
        Studies 2006 conference. It arguesthat, despite the recent renewal of academic
        interest in labour movements, there is a gap in contemporary research on organized
        labour around the existence of and potential futurerole for actually existing
        global trade unions. The purpose of this paper is to spark an interest amongst
        left academics in a future research project on the organizations whichcomprise
        the recently created Council of Global Unions, and in particular the recently
        created International Trade Union Confederation. After a brief introduction
        to the historyof these organizations and an outline of their activities, the
        author offers a number of questions that may prove interesting for those concerned
        about the future direction oforganized labour at the global level.", "end_page":
