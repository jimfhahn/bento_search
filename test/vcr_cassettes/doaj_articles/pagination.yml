        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>The association between lobular breast
        cancer and family history is not clear. The aim of the study was to possibly
        identifying new hereditary patterns predisposing for cancer in the different
        histopathologic subtypes of breast cancer, with focus on patients with lobular
        breast cancer and cancer in their first degree relatives.</p> <p>Methods</p>
        <p>In 1676 consecutive breast cancer patients detailed family history of cancer
        was related to histopathologic subtype of breast cancer.</p> <p>Results</p>
        <p>Patients with lobular breast cancer were found to be significantly positively
        associated with having a father diagnosed with cancer, OR 2.17 (95% confidence
        interval (CI) 1.37-3.46). The finding persisted after excluding breast cancer
        in the family. Ductal breast cancer was associated with having a mother diagnosed
        with cancer. There was a significant association between lobular breast cancer
        and having a father with prostate cancer, OR 2.4 (CI 1.1-5.3). The occurrence
        of having a father with prostate cancer for lobular breast cancer patients
        was higher in the younger patient group, OR 2.9 (CI 1.1-7.8), and was still
        high but lost statistical significance in the older patient group, OR 1.9
        (CI 0.5-7.4). The association between lobular breast cancer and a father remained
        significant after excluding fathers with prostate cancer, OR 1.94 (CI 1.20-3.14).
        Other commonly occurring tumor types in the father included sarcoma and leukemia.</p>
        <p>Conclusion</p> <p>We propose that lobular breast cancer is associated with
        having a father diagnosed with cancer, most commonly prostate carcinoma. Since
        the association remained after excluding family history of breast cancer,
        the association seems independent of classical breast cancer heredity. The
        association with a father diagnosed with cancer also remained after removing
        prostate cancer, indicating an independence from prostate cancer as well.
        The reason for this association is genetically unclear, but could involve
        sex-specific imprinting.</p> ", "subject": [{"code": "RC254-282", "term":

        collected cancer registration information for the year 2009 from local cancer
        registries and analyzed it to describe the incidences and mortalities of cancers
        in China. Based on the data quality criteria from NCCR, data from 104 registries
        covering 85,470,522 people (57,489,009 in urban areas and 27,981,513 in rural
        areas) were checked and evaluated. The data from 72 registries were qualified
        and accepted for the cancer registry annual report in 2012. The total cancer
        incident cases and cancer deaths were 244,366 and 154,310, respectively. The
        morphologically verified cases accounted for 67.23%, and 3.14% of the incident
        cases only had information from death certifications. The crude incidence
        in the Chinese cancer registration areas was 285.91/100,000 (317.97/100,000
        in males and 253.09/100,000 in females). The age-standardized rates for incidences
        based on the Chinese standard population (ASRIC) and the world standard population
        (ASRIW) were 146.87/100,000 and 191.72/100,000, respectively, with a cumulative
        incidence of 22.08%. The cancer mortality in the Chinese cancer registration
        areas was 180.54/100,000 (224.20/100,000 in males and 135.85/100,000 in females).
        The age-standardized rates for mortalities based on the Chinese standard population(ASRMC)
        and the world standard population (ASRMW) were 85.06/100,000 and 115.65/100,000,
        respectively, and the cumulative mortality was 12.94%. Lung cancer, gastric
        cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer,
        encephaloma, lymphoma, female breast cancer, and cervical cancer were the
        most common cancers, accounting for 75% of all cancer cases. Lung cancer,
        gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic
        cancer, breast cancer, encephaloma, leukemia, and lymphoma accounted for 80%
        of all cancer deaths. The cancer registration''s population coverage has been
        increasing, and its data quality is improving. As the basis of the cancer
        control program, the cancer registry plays an important role in directing
        anticancer strategies in the medium and long term. Because cancer burdens

        a wealth of information on the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic changes

        be included in a classification model to capture the known attributes of cancer
        stem cells and their potential contribution to treatment response, and metastases.
        The integrated model of cancer classification presented here incorporates
        all morphology, cancer stem cell contributions, genetic, and functional attributes
        of cancer. Integrated cancer classification models could eliminate the unclassifiable
        cancers as used in current classifications. Future cancer treatment may be

        cell and produce better treatments. In terms of drug delivery systems, nano
        particles enable unique approaches for cancer treatment. A large number of
        nanoparticle delivery systems have been developed for cancer therapy and currently
        they are in the preclinical stages of development. More recently developed
        nanoparticles are demonstrating the potential sophistication of these delivery

        pathways linking inflammation and cancer. Some possible mechanisms by which
        inflammation can contribute to carcinogenesis have been found. These mechanisms

        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>For years the Robert Koch Institute
        (RKI) has been annually pooling and reviewing the data from the German population-based
        cancer registries and evaluating them together with the cause-of-death statistics
        provided by the statistical offices. Traditionally, the RKI periodically estimates
        the number of new cancer cases in Germany on the basis of the available data
        from the regional cancer registries in which registration is complete; this
        figure, in turn, forms the basis for further important indicators.</p> <p>Methods</p>
        <p>This article gives a brief overview of current indicators - such as incidence,
        prevalence, mortality, survival rates - on the most common types of cancer,
        as well as important ratios on the risks of developing and dying of cancer
        in Germany.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>According to the latest estimate, there
        were a total of 436,500 new cancer cases in Germany in 2004. The most common
        cancer in men is prostate cancer with over 58,000 new cases per annum, followed
        by colorectal and lung cancer. In women, breast cancer remains the most common
        cancer with an estimated 57,000 new cases every year, also followed by colorectal
        cancer. These and further findings on selected cancer sites can be found in
        the current brochure on \"Cancer in Germany\", which is regularly published
        by the RKI together with the Association of Population-based Cancer Registries
        in Germany (GEKID). In addition, the RKI made cancer-prevalence estimates
        and calculated current morbidity and mortality risks at the federal level
        for the first time. According to these figures, the 5-year partial prevalence
        - i.e. the total number of cancer patients diagnosed over the past five years
        who are currently still living - exceeds 600,000 in men; the figure is about
        the same among women. Here, too, the most common cancers are prostate cancer
        in men and breast cancer in women. The lifetime risk of developing cancer,
        which is more related to the individual, is estimated to be higher among men
        (48.5%) than among women (40.3%). In roughly rounded figures, therefore, about
        every second person in Germany develops cancer in the course of their lives.
        One in four men and one in five women die of cancer.</p> <p>Conclusions</p>
        <p>In recent years, population-based cancer registration in Germany has come
        significantly closer to the aim of the complete, nationwide coverage of cancer.
        The continuous improvements in the data situation help describe cancer development
        in Germany.</p> ", "subject": [{"code": "RC254-282", "term": "Neoplasms. Tumors.

        that has progressed rapidly from being a research technique in laboratories
        to a routine clinical imaging modality. The most widely used radiotracer in
        PET is Fluorine18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F18-FDG), which is an analogue of glucose.
        The FDG uptake in cells is directly proportional to glucose metabolism of
        cells. Since glucose metabolism is increased many fold in malignant tumors
        PET has a high sensitivity and a high negative predictive value. PET with
        FDG is now the standard of care in initial staging, monitoring the response
        to the therapy, and management of lung cancer, colonic cancer, lymphoma, melanoma,
        esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer and breast cancer. Other indications
        of PET like bone tumor, ovarian cancer and cancer of unknown primary (CUP)

        "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer shows a characteristic tissue structure called
        desmoplasia, which consists of dense fibrotic stroma surrounding cancer cells.
        Interactions between pancreatic cancer cells and stromal cells promote invasive
        growth of cancer cells and establish a specific microenvironment such as hypoxia
        which further aggravates the malignant behavior of cancer cells. Pancreatic
        stellate cells (PSCs) play pivotal role in the development of fibrosis within
        the pancreatic cancer tissue, and also affect the cancer cell functions. PSCs
        induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell (CSC)-related
        phenotypes in pancreatic cancer cells by activating multiple signaling pathways.
        In addition, pancreatic cancer cells and PSCs recruit myeloid-derived suppressor
        cells which attenuate the immune reaction against pancreatic cancer cells.
        As a result, pancreatic cancer cells become refractory against conventional
        therapies. The formation of the CSC-niche by stromal cells facilitates postoperative
        recurrence, re-growth of therapy-resistant tumors and distant metastasis.
        Conventional therapies targeting cancer cells failed to conquer pancreatic
        cancer, but targeting stromal cells and immune cells effectively improved
        the therapeutic responses in experimental conditions. A combination of novel
        strategies altering stromal cell functions could contribute to improving the
        pancreatic cancer prognosis. ", "subject": [{"code": "QP1-981", "term": "Physiology",

        of individuals suffering from cancer illnesses are at risk of having subjected
        to mental health consequences. There is a paucity of data comparing the caregiver

        patients. To study the association of caregiver burden with demographic factors
        like age, gender, duration of caregiving etc. Materials & Methods:  This Cross
        sectional study is performed on the key relatives of patients of 31 cancer
        cervix and 31 cancer breast patients. Burden assessment schedule was used.
        Results:  Our findings suggest burden is more in male caregivers of breast
        cancer patients. It is not so in caregivers of cancer cervix patients. Whenever
        the caregiver is closely related to the patients the burden is high in both
        groups. Whenever the burden scores were high the depression scores were also
        high. Treatment modalities as a whole correlates with burden scores in caregivers

        diagnosis, prognosis, and epidemiology. A number of potential biomarkers have
        been identified for pancreatic cancer. These markers can be assayed in non-invasively
        collected biofluids. These biomarkers need analytical and clinical validation
        so that they can be used for the purpose of screening and diagnosing pancreatic
        cancer and determining disease prognosis. In this article, the latest developments
        in pancreatic cancer biomarkers are discussed. ", "end_page": "1837"}, "created_date":

        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>While knowledge and risk perception
        have been associated with screening for second primary cancer (SPC), there
        are no clinically useful indicators to identify who is at risk of not being
        properly screened for SPC. We investigated whether the mode of primary cancer
        detection (i.e. screen-detected vs. non-screen-detected) is associated with
        subsequent completion of all appropriate SPC screening in cancer survivors.</p>
        <p>Methods</p> <p>Data were collected from cancer patients treated at the
        National Cancer Center and nine regional cancer centers across Korea. A total
        of 512 cancer survivors older than 40, time since diagnosis more than 2 years,
        and whose first primary cancer was not advanced or metastasized were selected.
        Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine factors, including mode
        of primary cancer detection, associated with completion of all appropriate
        SPC screening according to national cancer screening guidelines.</p> <p>Results</p>
        <p>Being screen-detected for their first primary cancer was found to be significantly
        associated with completion of all appropriate SPC screening (adjusted odds
        ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.36\u20133.33), after controlling for
        demographic and clinical variables. Screen-detected cancer survivors were
        significantly more likely to have higher household income, have other comorbidities,
        and be within 5 years since diagnosis.</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>The mode
        of primary cancer detection, a readily available clinical information, can
        be used as an indicator for screening practice for SPC in cancer survivors.
        Education about the importance of SPC screening will be helpful particularly
        for cancer survivors whose primary cancer was not screen-detected.</p> ",

        evidence suggests that the capacity of a tumor to grow and propagate is dependent
        on a small subset of cells within a tumor, termed cancer stem cells. In fact,
        cancer cells, like stem cells, can proliferate indefinitely through a dysregulated
        cellular self-renewal capacity. Cancer stem cells may originate due to the
        distribution into self-renewal and differentiation pathways occurring in multi-potential
        stem cells, tissue-specific stem cells, progenitor cells and cancer cells.
        Recent studies have shown that ovarian cancer also contains stem cells or
        tumor-initiating cells. Moreover, ovarian serous adenocarcinomas were disaggregated
        and subjected to growth conditions to select for self-renewing, non-adherent
        spheroids previously shown to be derived from tissue stem cells. A recent
        study showed that epithelial ovarian cancer was derived from a sub population
        of CD44<sup>+</sup>, CD117<sup>+ </sup>and CD133<sup>+ </sup>cells. The existence
        of cancer stem cells would explain why only a small minority of cancer cells
        is capable of extensive proliferation of the tumor. In this review, we have
        discussed the studies on ovarian cancer stem cells along with the molecular
        pathways that could be involved in these cancer stem cells.</p> ", "subject":
