        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>For years the Robert Koch Institute
        (RKI) has been annually pooling and reviewing the data from the German population-based
        cancer registries and evaluating them together with the cause-of-death statistics
        provided by the statistical offices. Traditionally, the RKI periodically estimates
        the number of new cancer cases in Germany on the basis of the available data
        from the regional cancer registries in which registration is complete; this
        figure, in turn, forms the basis for further important indicators.</p> <p>Methods</p>
        <p>This article gives a brief overview of current indicators - such as incidence,
        prevalence, mortality, survival rates - on the most common types of cancer,
        as well as important ratios on the risks of developing and dying of cancer
        in Germany.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>According to the latest estimate, there
        were a total of 436,500 new cancer cases in Germany in 2004. The most common
        cancer in men is prostate cancer with over 58,000 new cases per annum, followed
        by colorectal and lung cancer. In women, breast cancer remains the most common
        cancer with an estimated 57,000 new cases every year, also followed by colorectal
        cancer. These and further findings on selected cancer sites can be found in
        the current brochure on \"Cancer in Germany\", which is regularly published
        by the RKI together with the Association of Population-based Cancer Registries
        in Germany (GEKID). In addition, the RKI made cancer-prevalence estimates
        and calculated current morbidity and mortality risks at the federal level
        for the first time. According to these figures, the 5-year partial prevalence
        - i.e. the total number of cancer patients diagnosed over the past five years
        who are currently still living - exceeds 600,000 in men; the figure is about
        the same among women. Here, too, the most common cancers are prostate cancer
        in men and breast cancer in women. The lifetime risk of developing cancer,
        which is more related to the individual, is estimated to be higher among men
        (48.5%) than among women (40.3%). In roughly rounded figures, therefore, about
        every second person in Germany develops cancer in the course of their lives.
        One in four men and one in five women die of cancer.</p> <p>Conclusions</p>
        <p>In recent years, population-based cancer registration in Germany has come
        significantly closer to the aim of the complete, nationwide coverage of cancer.
        The continuous improvements in the data situation help describe cancer development
        in Germany.</p> ", "subject": [{"code": "RC254-282", "term": "Neoplasms. Tumors.

        that has progressed rapidly from being a research technique in laboratories
        to a routine clinical imaging modality. The most widely used radiotracer in
        PET is Fluorine18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F18-FDG), which is an analogue of glucose.
        The FDG uptake in cells is directly proportional to glucose metabolism of
        cells. Since glucose metabolism is increased many fold in malignant tumors
        PET has a high sensitivity and a high negative predictive value. PET with
        FDG is now the standard of care in initial staging, monitoring the response
        to the therapy, and management of lung cancer, colonic cancer, lymphoma, melanoma,
        esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer and breast cancer. Other indications
        of PET like bone tumor, ovarian cancer and cancer of unknown primary (CUP)
        has also been discussed in brief. The aim of this review article is to review
        the clinical applications of PET in various malignancies and only limited

        "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer shows a characteristic tissue structure called
        desmoplasia, which consists of dense fibrotic stroma surrounding cancer cells.
        Interactions between pancreatic cancer cells and stromal cells promote invasive
        growth of cancer cells and establish a specific microenvironment such as hypoxia
        which further aggravates the malignant behavior of cancer cells. Pancreatic
        stellate cells (PSCs) play pivotal role in the development of fibrosis within
        the pancreatic cancer tissue, and also affect the cancer cell functions. PSCs
        induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell (CSC)-related
        phenotypes in pancreatic cancer cells by activating multiple signaling pathways.
        In addition, pancreatic cancer cells and PSCs recruit myeloid-derived suppressor
        cells which attenuate the immune reaction against pancreatic cancer cells.
        As a result, pancreatic cancer cells become refractory against conventional
        therapies. The formation of the CSC-niche by stromal cells facilitates postoperative
        recurrence, re-growth of therapy-resistant tumors and distant metastasis.
        Conventional therapies targeting cancer cells failed to conquer pancreatic
        cancer, but targeting stromal cells and immune cells effectively improved
        the therapeutic responses in experimental conditions. A combination of novel
        strategies altering stromal cell functions could contribute to improving the
        pancreatic cancer prognosis. ", "subject": [{"code": "QP1-981", "term": "Physiology",

        the survival rate from ovarian cancer is disappointingly low when compared
        to that of breast or prostate cancer.  One of the factors contributing to
        the poor survival rate from ovarian cancer is the development of chemotherapy

        discuss the potential role of the tumor microenvironment in ovarian cancer

        of individuals suffering from cancer illnesses are at risk of having subjected
        to mental health consequences. There is a paucity of data comparing the caregiver
        burden of cancer breast and cancer cervix patients. Aim:  The aim of the present
        study is to compare the caregiver burden of cancer breast and cancer cervix
        patients. To study the association of caregiver burden with demographic factors
        like age, gender, duration of caregiving etc. Materials & Methods:  This Cross
        sectional study is performed on the key relatives of patients of 31 cancer
        cervix and 31 cancer breast patients. Burden assessment schedule was used.
        Results:  Our findings suggest burden is more in male caregivers of breast
        cancer patients. It is not so in caregivers of cancer cervix patients. Whenever
        the caregiver is closely related to the patients the burden is high in both
        groups. Whenever the burden scores were high the depression scores were also
        high. Treatment modalities as a whole correlates with burden scores in caregivers
        of breast cancer patients but not in cancer cervix patients. Conclusion:  Caregivers
        with breast and cervical cancer patients are vulnerable if the caregiver is
        male, from low socioeconomical background, more closely related and when the
        patients received poor treatment modalities.", "author": [{"affiliation":

        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>While knowledge and risk perception
        have been associated with screening for second primary cancer (SPC), there
        are no clinically useful indicators to identify who is at risk of not being
        properly screened for SPC. We investigated whether the mode of primary cancer
        detection (i.e. screen-detected vs. non-screen-detected) is associated with
        subsequent completion of all appropriate SPC screening in cancer survivors.</p>
        <p>Methods</p> <p>Data were collected from cancer patients treated at the
        National Cancer Center and nine regional cancer centers across Korea. A total
        of 512 cancer survivors older than 40, time since diagnosis more than 2 years,
        and whose first primary cancer was not advanced or metastasized were selected.
        Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine factors, including mode
        of primary cancer detection, associated with completion of all appropriate
        SPC screening according to national cancer screening guidelines.</p> <p>Results</p>
        <p>Being screen-detected for their first primary cancer was found to be significantly
        associated with completion of all appropriate SPC screening (adjusted odds
        ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.36\u20133.33), after controlling for
        demographic and clinical variables. Screen-detected cancer survivors were
        significantly more likely to have higher household income, have other comorbidities,
        and be within 5 years since diagnosis.</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>The mode
        of primary cancer detection, a readily available clinical information, can
        be used as an indicator for screening practice for SPC in cancer survivors.
        Education about the importance of SPC screening will be helpful particularly
        for cancer survivors whose primary cancer was not screen-detected.</p> ",

        evidence suggests that the capacity of a tumor to grow and propagate is dependent
        on a small subset of cells within a tumor, termed cancer stem cells. In fact,
        cancer cells, like stem cells, can proliferate indefinitely through a dysregulated
        cellular self-renewal capacity. Cancer stem cells may originate due to the
        distribution into self-renewal and differentiation pathways occurring in multi-potential
        stem cells, tissue-specific stem cells, progenitor cells and cancer cells.
        Recent studies have shown that ovarian cancer also contains stem cells or
        tumor-initiating cells. Moreover, ovarian serous adenocarcinomas were disaggregated
        and subjected to growth conditions to select for self-renewing, non-adherent
        spheroids previously shown to be derived from tissue stem cells. A recent
        study showed that epithelial ovarian cancer was derived from a sub population
        of CD44<sup>+</sup>, CD117<sup>+ </sup>and CD133<sup>+ </sup>cells. The existence
        of cancer stem cells would explain why only a small minority of cancer cells
        is capable of extensive proliferation of the tumor. In this review, we have
        discussed the studies on ovarian cancer stem cells along with the molecular
        pathways that could be involved in these cancer stem cells.</p> ", "subject":
