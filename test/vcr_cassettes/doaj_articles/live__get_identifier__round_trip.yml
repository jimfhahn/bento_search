        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>The association between lobular breast
        cancer and family history is not clear. The aim of the study was to possibly
        identifying new hereditary patterns predisposing for cancer in the different
        histopathologic subtypes of breast cancer, with focus on patients with lobular
        breast cancer and cancer in their first degree relatives.</p> <p>Methods</p>
        <p>In 1676 consecutive breast cancer patients detailed family history of cancer
        was related to histopathologic subtype of breast cancer.</p> <p>Results</p>
        <p>Patients with lobular breast cancer were found to be significantly positively
        associated with having a father diagnosed with cancer, OR 2.17 (95% confidence
        interval (CI) 1.37-3.46). The finding persisted after excluding breast cancer
        in the family. Ductal breast cancer was associated with having a mother diagnosed
        with cancer. There was a significant association between lobular breast cancer
        and having a father with prostate cancer, OR 2.4 (CI 1.1-5.3). The occurrence
        of having a father with prostate cancer for lobular breast cancer patients
        was higher in the younger patient group, OR 2.9 (CI 1.1-7.8), and was still
        high but lost statistical significance in the older patient group, OR 1.9
        (CI 0.5-7.4). The association between lobular breast cancer and a father remained
        significant after excluding fathers with prostate cancer, OR 1.94 (CI 1.20-3.14).
        Other commonly occurring tumor types in the father included sarcoma and leukemia.</p>
        <p>Conclusion</p> <p>We propose that lobular breast cancer is associated with
        having a father diagnosed with cancer, most commonly prostate carcinoma. Since
        the association remained after excluding family history of breast cancer,
        the association seems independent of classical breast cancer heredity. The
        association with a father diagnosed with cancer also remained after removing
        prostate cancer, indicating an independence from prostate cancer as well.
        The reason for this association is genetically unclear, but could involve
        sex-specific imprinting.</p> ", "subject": [{"code": "RC254-282", "term":

        collected cancer registration information for the year 2009 from local cancer
        registries and analyzed it to describe the incidences and mortalities of cancers
        in China. Based on the data quality criteria from NCCR, data from 104 registries
        covering 85,470,522 people (57,489,009 in urban areas and 27,981,513 in rural
        areas) were checked and evaluated. The data from 72 registries were qualified
        and accepted for the cancer registry annual report in 2012. The total cancer
        incident cases and cancer deaths were 244,366 and 154,310, respectively. The
        morphologically verified cases accounted for 67.23%, and 3.14% of the incident
        cases only had information from death certifications. The crude incidence
        in the Chinese cancer registration areas was 285.91/100,000 (317.97/100,000
        in males and 253.09/100,000 in females). The age-standardized rates for incidences
        based on the Chinese standard population (ASRIC) and the world standard population
        (ASRIW) were 146.87/100,000 and 191.72/100,000, respectively, with a cumulative
        incidence of 22.08%. The cancer mortality in the Chinese cancer registration
        areas was 180.54/100,000 (224.20/100,000 in males and 135.85/100,000 in females).
        The age-standardized rates for mortalities based on the Chinese standard population(ASRMC)
        and the world standard population (ASRMW) were 85.06/100,000 and 115.65/100,000,
        respectively, and the cumulative mortality was 12.94%. Lung cancer, gastric
        cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer,
        encephaloma, lymphoma, female breast cancer, and cervical cancer were the
        most common cancers, accounting for 75% of all cancer cases. Lung cancer,
        gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic
        cancer, breast cancer, encephaloma, leukemia, and lymphoma accounted for 80%
        of all cancer deaths. The cancer registration''s population coverage has been
        increasing, and its data quality is improving. As the basis of the cancer
        control program, the cancer registry plays an important role in directing
        anticancer strategies in the medium and long term. Because cancer burdens
        are different in urban and rural areas in China, prevention and control efforts

        a wealth of information on the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic changes

        be included in a classification model to capture the known attributes of cancer
        stem cells and their potential contribution to treatment response, and metastases.
        The integrated model of cancer classification presented here incorporates
        all morphology, cancer stem cell contributions, genetic, and functional attributes
        of cancer. Integrated cancer classification models could eliminate the unclassifiable
        cancers as used in current classifications. Future cancer treatment may be
