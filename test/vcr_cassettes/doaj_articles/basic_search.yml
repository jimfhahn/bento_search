Trustworthy information offered in a spirit of companionship. “This is the best source for readable, up-to-date information—from the world’s experts.” —Dr. Thomas J. Smith, Johns Hopkins Hospital “If you’re looking for a comprehensive, easy-to-read book about an often confusing topic, The Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer Book is for you.” —Henry M. Kuerer, M.D., Ph.D., FACS, Professor and Director, Breast Surgical Oncology Training Program, MD Anderson Cancer Center “Readers will likely return again and again to this book as a convenient source of knowledge, insight, and reassurance as they confront the many decisions required in the treatment of breast cancer.” —Clifford A. Hudis, M.D., Chief, Breast Cancer Medicine Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Mayo Clinic Cancer Center is dedicated to understanding and discovering new ways to predict, prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, transforming the quality of life for cancer patients today and into the future. With a multisite national presence, its three campuses—in Pheonix/Scottsdale, Ariz.; Jacksonville, Fla.; and Rochester, Minn.—offer a broad geographic reach to serve patients. Designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center is a leader in translating discoveries into effective improvements in patient care. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Mayo Clinic took root in farm fields near Rochester, Minn., in the late 1800s. It grew from the medical practice of a country doctor, William Worrall Mayo, and the partnership of his two sons, William J. and Charles H. Mayo—affectionately known as Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie. The brothers' innovative ideas and tireless work in learning and creating new surgical techniques attracted international attention. Physicians from around the world came to watch the Mayo brothers perform surgery. The Mayo brothers invited other doctors to join them, forming teams of medical experts. Today, Mayo Clinic—one of the world’s oldest and largest multispecialty group practices—comprises more than 45,000 physicians, scientists, nurses and other staff at its three locations in Rochester, Minn., Jacksonville, Fla., and Scottsdale, Ariz., and its regional community-based health care practices.",

Now, a new edition addresses current developments in cancer research and offers more tips on how people living with cancer can fight it and how healthy people can prevent it. The new edition of Anticancer includes: • The latest research on anticancer foods, including new alternatives to sugar and cautions about some that are now on the market • New information about how vitamin D strengthens the immune system • Warnings about common food contaminants that have recently been proven to contribute to cancer progression • A new chapter on mind-body approaches to stress reduction, with recent studies that show how our reactions to stress can interfere with natural defenses and how friendships can support healing in ways never before understood • A groundbreaking study showing that lifestyle modification, as originally proposed in Anticancer, reduces mortality for breast cancer by an astounding 68 percent after completion of treatment • New supporting evidence for the entire Anticancer program",

Why, for example, have women always had such a raw deal in the cancer stakes? And why are some cancers, such as prostate cancer, increasing in incidence? Greaves argues that Darwinian selection millions of years ago has endowed our genes and cells with inherently cancerous credentials, and this is exacerbated by our rapid social evolution and exotic behavioural traits that outpace genetic adaptation. The book is full of novel insights, the latest scientific discoveries, and wonderful historical anecdotes. It provides a unique portrait of cancer, past, present, and future.",

        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>The association between lobular breast
        cancer and family history is not clear. The aim of the study was to possibly
        identifying new hereditary patterns predisposing for cancer in the different
        histopathologic subtypes of breast cancer, with focus on patients with lobular
        breast cancer and cancer in their first degree relatives.</p> <p>Methods</p>
        <p>In 1676 consecutive breast cancer patients detailed family history of cancer
        was related to histopathologic subtype of breast cancer.</p> <p>Results</p>
        <p>Patients with lobular breast cancer were found to be significantly positively
        associated with having a father diagnosed with cancer, OR 2.17 (95% confidence
        interval (CI) 1.37-3.46). The finding persisted after excluding breast cancer
        in the family. Ductal breast cancer was associated with having a mother diagnosed
        with cancer. There was a significant association between lobular breast cancer
        and having a father with prostate cancer, OR 2.4 (CI 1.1-5.3). The occurrence
        of having a father with prostate cancer for lobular breast cancer patients
        was higher in the younger patient group, OR 2.9 (CI 1.1-7.8), and was still
        high but lost statistical significance in the older patient group, OR 1.9
        (CI 0.5-7.4). The association between lobular breast cancer and a father remained
        significant after excluding fathers with prostate cancer, OR 1.94 (CI 1.20-3.14).
        Other commonly occurring tumor types in the father included sarcoma and leukemia.</p>
        <p>Conclusion</p> <p>We propose that lobular breast cancer is associated with
        having a father diagnosed with cancer, most commonly prostate carcinoma. Since
        the association remained after excluding family history of breast cancer,
        the association seems independent of classical breast cancer heredity. The
        association with a father diagnosed with cancer also remained after removing
        prostate cancer, indicating an independence from prostate cancer as well.
        The reason for this association is genetically unclear, but could involve
        sex-specific imprinting.</p> ", "subject": [{"code": "RC254-282", "term":

        collected cancer registration information for the year 2009 from local cancer
        registries and analyzed it to describe the incidences and mortalities of cancers
        in China. Based on the data quality criteria from NCCR, data from 104 registries
        covering 85,470,522 people (57,489,009 in urban areas and 27,981,513 in rural
        areas) were checked and evaluated. The data from 72 registries were qualified
        and accepted for the cancer registry annual report in 2012. The total cancer
        incident cases and cancer deaths were 244,366 and 154,310, respectively. The
        morphologically verified cases accounted for 67.23%, and 3.14% of the incident
        cases only had information from death certifications. The crude incidence
        in the Chinese cancer registration areas was 285.91/100,000 (317.97/100,000
        in males and 253.09/100,000 in females). The age-standardized rates for incidences
        based on the Chinese standard population (ASRIC) and the world standard population
        (ASRIW) were 146.87/100,000 and 191.72/100,000, respectively, with a cumulative
        incidence of 22.08%. The cancer mortality in the Chinese cancer registration
        areas was 180.54/100,000 (224.20/100,000 in males and 135.85/100,000 in females).
        The age-standardized rates for mortalities based on the Chinese standard population(ASRMC)
        and the world standard population (ASRMW) were 85.06/100,000 and 115.65/100,000,
        respectively, and the cumulative mortality was 12.94%. Lung cancer, gastric
        cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer,
        encephaloma, lymphoma, female breast cancer, and cervical cancer were the
        most common cancers, accounting for 75% of all cancer cases. Lung cancer,
        gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic
        cancer, breast cancer, encephaloma, leukemia, and lymphoma accounted for 80%
        of all cancer deaths. The cancer registration''s population coverage has been
        increasing, and its data quality is improving. As the basis of the cancer
        control program, the cancer registry plays an important role in directing
        anticancer strategies in the medium and long term. Because cancer burdens
        are different in urban and rural areas in China, prevention and control efforts
        should be based on practical situations.  ", "end_page": "112"}, "created_date":

        "abstract": "<p>Human cancer classification is currently based on the idea
        of cell of origin, light and electron microscopic attributes of the cancer.
        What is not yet integrated into cancer classification are the functional attributes
        of these cancer cells. Recent innovative techniques in biology have provided
        a wealth of information on the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic changes
        in cancer cells. The emergence of the concept of cancer stem cells needs to
        be included in a classification model to capture the known attributes of cancer
        stem cells and their potential contribution to treatment response, and metastases.
        The integrated model of cancer classification presented here incorporates

        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>The association between lobular breast
        cancer and family history is not clear. The aim of the study was to possibly
        identifying new hereditary patterns predisposing for cancer in the different
        histopathologic subtypes of breast cancer, with focus on patients with lobular
        breast cancer and cancer in their first degree relatives.</p> <p>Methods</p>
        <p>In 1676 consecutive breast cancer patients detailed family history of cancer
        was related to histopathologic subtype of breast cancer.</p> <p>Results</p>
        <p>Patients with lobular breast cancer were found to be significantly positively
        associated with having a father diagnosed with cancer, OR 2.17 (95% confidence
        interval (CI) 1.37-3.46). The finding persisted after excluding breast cancer
        in the family. Ductal breast cancer was associated with having a mother diagnosed
        with cancer. There was a significant association between lobular breast cancer
        and having a father with prostate cancer, OR 2.4 (CI 1.1-5.3). The occurrence
        of having a father with prostate cancer for lobular breast cancer patients
        was higher in the younger patient group, OR 2.9 (CI 1.1-7.8), and was still
        high but lost statistical significance in the older patient group, OR 1.9
        (CI 0.5-7.4). The association between lobular breast cancer and a father remained
        significant after excluding fathers with prostate cancer, OR 1.94 (CI 1.20-3.14).
        Other commonly occurring tumor types in the father included sarcoma and leukemia.</p>
        <p>Conclusion</p> <p>We propose that lobular breast cancer is associated with
        having a father diagnosed with cancer, most commonly prostate carcinoma. Since
        the association remained after excluding family history of breast cancer,
        the association seems independent of classical breast cancer heredity. The
        association with a father diagnosed with cancer also remained after removing
        prostate cancer, indicating an independence from prostate cancer as well.
        The reason for this association is genetically unclear, but could involve
        sex-specific imprinting.</p> ", "subject": [{"code": "RC254-282", "term":

        new molecular biology techniques, recent studies have implicated a common

        cell lesions. Our aims were to assess the frequency of lobular neoplasia in
        a series of breast biopsies that were performed and examined in the same institution
        and to analyze the association between subtypes of lobular neoplasia and benign
        and malignant breast lesions.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>Cases were selected after
        reviewing archived pathological reports in the Breast Pathology Laboratory,
        School of Medicine of Federal University of Minas Gerais (1999-2008). Cases
        of lobular neoplasia were reviewed and classified as atypical lobular hyperplasia,
        ductal involvement by cells of atypical lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma
        <it>in situ</it>, and pleomorphic lobular carcinoma <it>in situ</it>. Coexistence
        of lobular neoplasia with other breast lesions, including columnar cell lesions,
        invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma, was evaluated. The
        association between lobular neoplasia and breast lesions was analyzed by Fisher''s
        exact test and chi-square test for linear trend.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>We
        analyzed 5650 breast specimens, selecting 135 breast specimens (2.4%) that
        had a diagnosis of lobular neoplasia, corresponding to 106 patients. Hematoxylin
        and eosin-stained slides were available for 84 cases, 5 of which were excluded
        because they contained only \"indeterminate\" <it>in situ </it>lesions. Of
        the 79 remaining cases, columnar cell lesions were present in 78.5%, primarily
        with columnar cell changes without atypia (67.7%). Invasive carcinoma was
        present in 45.6% of cases of lobular neoplasia--a similar frequency (47.2%)
        as invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma. We noted a significant
        linear trend (p < 0.03) of a higher frequency of invasive carcinomas that
        were concomitant with lobular carcinoma <it>in situ </it>compared with atypical
        lobular hyperplasia. Invasive lobular carcinomas were associated with lobular
        carcinoma <it>in situ </it>in 33% of cases, compared with 2.8% of atypical
        lobular hyperplasia cases.</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>Our findings confirm
        a frequent association between lobular neoplasia and columnar cell lesions,
        the majority of which lacked atypia. We also observed a greater frequency

        Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,
        Cooper University Hospital, Camden, NJ, USA  Abstract: Cancer is diagnosed
        approximately once per 1,000 pregnancies; most commonly due to the reproductive
        age of the women, these include breast, cervical, melanoma, thyroid, and Hodgkin&#39;s
        lymphoma diagnoses. As a single diagnosis, breast cancer is the most common
        cancer diagnosed during pregnancy. Cancer is expected to complicate pregnancy
        more often due to the trend for women to delay child bearing to later maternal
        ages. Delayed first birth is itself a risk factor for breast cancer. Termination
        of pregnancy has not been shown to afford a survival benefit. While protecting
        the interests of mother and unborn fetus, breast cancer can be safely diagnosed,
        staged, and treated during pregnancy with good outcomes for both. Some modification
        of the protocols used for nonpregnant women with suspicious palpable breast
        masses is required. This article reviews the challenges for physicians in
        making the diagnosis of breast cancer during pregnancy and upon diagnosis,
        counseling patients about treatment options. The consequences of diagnostic
        investigations and cancer treatment for the exposed fetus are also addressed.  Keywords:

        TN, USA  Abstract: More than 40% of all breast cancer cases are diagnosed
        in patients aged &ge;65 years, accounting for an ever-increasing disease burden
        in the elderly. Historically, however, this growing population of breast cancer
        patients has been underrepresented in clinical trials, resulting in a paucity
        of data that clinicians can reference in making treatment decisions for their
        older patients. A consequence may be the undertreatment of elderly patients,
        who have the highest incidence of breast cancer. However, subgroup analyses
        of elderly patients in multiple early-Phase (I or II) studies and a handful
        of small studies with elderly-specific populations have suggested that older
        patients may experience similar benefit from cancer therapy as younger patients
        with otherwise similar baseline characteristics. Although steps should be
        taken to avoid undertreating older patients, a balance must be achieved to
        avoid overtreatment. Guidelines have been released detailing recommendations
        for the treatment of elderly breast cancer patients, including a discussion
        of various geriatric assessments that might aid physicians in selecting patients
        appropriate for recommended treatment options. Chemotherapy remains a key
        component of treatment regimens for many older patients. However, the benefit
        of some agents may be limited by tolerability issues. Taxanes, one of the
        most established classes of chemotherapy for breast cancer, are known to be
        highly active and efficacious and to have well-characterized safety profiles.
        This review discusses factors that influence treatment choices for elderly
        patients with metastatic breast cancer, and then focuses on clinical data
        for taxanes in this patient population.  Keywords: breast cancer, elderly,

        At time of presentation, fewer than 10% of patients have metastatic breast
        cancer. The most common sites of metastasis in order of frequency are bone,
        lung, pleura, soft tissue, and liver. Breast cancer metastasis to the uterus
        or gallbladder is rare and has infrequently been reported in the English literature.\nPresentation
        of case: A 47 year old female with a recent history of thrombocytopenia presented
        with abnormal vaginal bleeding. Pelvic ultrasound revealed multiple uterine
        fibroids and endometrial curettings revealed cells consistent with lobular
        carcinoma of the breast. Breast examination revealed edema and induration
        of the lower half of the right breast. Biopsy of the right breast revealed
        invasive lobular carcinoma. Bone marrow aspiration obtained at a previous
        outpatient visit revealed extensive involvement by metastatic breast carcinoma.
        Shortly after discharge, the patient presented with acute cholecystitis and
        underwent cholecystectomy. Microscopic examination of the gallbladder revealed
        metastatic infiltrating lobular carcinoma. The final diagnosis was invasive
        lobular carcinoma of the right breast with metastasis to the bone marrow,
        endometrium, gallbladder, regional lymph nodes, and peritoneum.\nDiscussion:
        The growth pattern of invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast is unique and
        poses a challenge in diagnosing the cancer at an early stage. Unlike other
        types of breast cancer, it tends to metastasize more to the peritoneum, ovary,
        and gastrointestinal tract. Metastasis to the endometrium or gallbladder is
        rare.\nConclusion: Metastatic spread should be considered in the differential
        diagnosis of patients with invasive lobular breast carcinoma presenting with
        abnormal vaginal bleeding or acute cholecystitis.", "subject": [{"code": "RD1-811",

        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>Clinical relevance of tumor infiltrating
        lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer is controversial. Here, we used a tumor
        microarray including a large series of ductal and lobular breast cancers with
        long term follow up data, to analyze clinical impact of TIL expressing specific
        phenotypes and distribution of TILs within different tumor compartments and
        in different histological subtypes.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>A tissue microarray
        (TMA) including 894 ductal and 164 lobular breast cancers was stained with
        antibodies recognizing CD4, FOXP3, and IL-17 by standard immunohistochemical
        techniques. Lymphocyte counts were correlated with clinico-pathological parameters
        and survival.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>CD4<sup>+ </sup>lymphocytes were more
        prevalent than FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>TILs whereas IL-17<sup>+ </sup>TILs were
        rare. Increased numbers of total CD4<sup>+ </sup>and FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>TIL
        were observed in ductal, as compared with lobular carcinomas. High grade (G3)
        and estrogen receptor (ER) negative ductal carcinomas displayed significantly
        (<it>p </it> < 0.001) higher CD4<sup>+ </sup>and FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>lymphocyte
        infiltration while her2/neu over-expression in ductal carcinomas was significantly
        (<it>p </it> < 0.001) associated with higher FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>TIL counts.
        In contrast, lymphocyte infiltration was not linked to any clinico-pathological
        parameters in lobular cancers. In univariate but not in multivariate analysis
        CD4<sup>+ </sup>infiltration was associated with significantly shorter survival
        in patients bearing ductal, but not lobular cancers. However, a FOXP3<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+
        </sup>ratio > 1 was associated with improved overall survival even in multivariate
        analysis (<it>p </it>= 0.033).</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>Ductal and lobular
        breast cancers appear to be infiltrated by different lymphocyte subpopulations.
        In ductal cancers increased CD4<sup>+ </sup>and FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>TIL numbers
        are associated with more aggressive tumor features. In survival analysis,
        absolute numbers of TILs do not represent major prognostic indicators in ductal
        and lobular breast cancer. Remarkably however, a ratio > 1 of total FOXP3<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+
        </sup>TILs in ductal carcinoma appears to represent an independent favorable
        prognostic factor.</p> ", "subject": [{"code": "RC254-282", "term": "Neoplasms.

        PA, USA Abstract: Risk factors allow us to define women who are at increased
        lifetime risk for breast cancer, and the most important factor is age. Benign
        breast disease increases risk, and the most important histologies are atypical
        lobular or ductal hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ. Family history
        of breast cancer among first-degree relatives (mother, sisters, daughters)
        also increases risk. Quantitative measures of risk give accurate predictions
        of breast cancer incidence for groups of women but not for individual subjects.
        Multiple published, randomized controlled trials, which employed selective
        estrogen receptor (ER) modulators (SERMs), have demonstrated consistent reductions
        of 35% or greater in the risk of ER-positive invasive and noninvasive breast
        cancer in postmenopausal women. Professional organizations in the US now recommend
        the use of SERMs to reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk, postmenopausal
        women. Raloxifene and tamoxifen reduce the risk of ER-positive invasive breast
        cancer with equal efficacy, but raloxifene is associated with a lower risk
        of thromboembolic disease, benign uterine conditions, and cataracts than tamoxifen
        in postmenopausal women. No evidence exists establishing whether a reduction
        in breast cancer risk from either agent translates into reduced breast cancer
        mortality. Overall quality of life is similar with raloxifene or tamoxifen,
        but the incidence of dyspareunia, weight gain, and musculoskeletal complaints
        is higher with raloxifene use, whereas vasomotor symptoms, bladder incontinence,
        gynecologic symptoms, and leg cramps were higher with tamoxifen use. Keywords:

        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>The association between lobular breast
        cancer and family history is not clear. The aim of the study was to possibly
        identifying new hereditary patterns predisposing for cancer in the different
        histopathologic subtypes of breast cancer, with focus on patients with lobular
        breast cancer and cancer in their first degree relatives.</p> <p>Methods</p>
        <p>In 1676 consecutive breast cancer patients detailed family history of cancer
        was related to histopathologic subtype of breast cancer.</p> <p>Results</p>
        <p>Patients with lobular breast cancer were found to be significantly positively
        associated with having a father diagnosed with cancer, OR 2.17 (95% confidence
        interval (CI) 1.37-3.46). The finding persisted after excluding breast cancer
        in the family. Ductal breast cancer was associated with having a mother diagnosed
        with cancer. There was a significant association between lobular breast cancer
        and having a father with prostate cancer, OR 2.4 (CI 1.1-5.3). The occurrence
        of having a father with prostate cancer for lobular breast cancer patients
        was higher in the younger patient group, OR 2.9 (CI 1.1-7.8), and was still
        high but lost statistical significance in the older patient group, OR 1.9
        (CI 0.5-7.4). The association between lobular breast cancer and a father remained
        significant after excluding fathers with prostate cancer, OR 1.94 (CI 1.20-3.14).
        Other commonly occurring tumor types in the father included sarcoma and leukemia.</p>
        <p>Conclusion</p> <p>We propose that lobular breast cancer is associated with
        having a father diagnosed with cancer, most commonly prostate carcinoma. Since
        the association remained after excluding family history of breast cancer,
        the association seems independent of classical breast cancer heredity. The
        association with a father diagnosed with cancer also remained after removing
        prostate cancer, indicating an independence from prostate cancer as well.
        The reason for this association is genetically unclear, but could involve
        sex-specific imprinting.</p> ", "subject": [{"code": "RC254-282", "term":

        a series of breast biopsies that were performed and examined in the same institution
        and to analyze the association between subtypes of lobular neoplasia and benign
        and malignant breast lesions.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>Cases were selected after
        reviewing archived pathological reports in the Breast Pathology Laboratory,
        School of Medicine of Federal University of Minas Gerais (1999-2008). Cases
        of lobular neoplasia were reviewed and classified as atypical lobular hyperplasia,
        ductal involvement by cells of atypical lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma
        <it>in situ</it>, and pleomorphic lobular carcinoma <it>in situ</it>. Coexistence
        of lobular neoplasia with other breast lesions, including columnar cell lesions,
        invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma, was evaluated. The

        analyzed 5650 breast specimens, selecting 135 breast specimens (2.4%) that
        had a diagnosis of lobular neoplasia, corresponding to 106 patients. Hematoxylin
        and eosin-stained slides were available for 84 cases, 5 of which were excluded
        because they contained only \"indeterminate\" <it>in situ </it>lesions. Of
        the 79 remaining cases, columnar cell lesions were present in 78.5%, primarily
        with columnar cell changes without atypia (67.7%). Invasive carcinoma was
        present in 45.6% of cases of lobular neoplasia--a similar frequency (47.2%)
        as invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma. We noted a significant
        linear trend (p < 0.03) of a higher frequency of invasive carcinomas that
        were concomitant with lobular carcinoma <it>in situ </it>compared with atypical
        lobular hyperplasia. Invasive lobular carcinomas were associated with lobular

        a frequent association between lobular neoplasia and columnar cell lesions,
        the majority of which lacked atypia. We also observed a greater frequency

        Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,
        Cooper University Hospital, Camden, NJ, USA  Abstract: Cancer is diagnosed
        approximately once per 1,000 pregnancies; most commonly due to the reproductive
        age of the women, these include breast, cervical, melanoma, thyroid, and Hodgkin&#39;s
        lymphoma diagnoses. As a single diagnosis, breast cancer is the most common
        cancer diagnosed during pregnancy. Cancer is expected to complicate pregnancy
        more often due to the trend for women to delay child bearing to later maternal
        ages. Delayed first birth is itself a risk factor for breast cancer. Termination
        of pregnancy has not been shown to afford a survival benefit. While protecting
        the interests of mother and unborn fetus, breast cancer can be safely diagnosed,
        staged, and treated during pregnancy with good outcomes for both. Some modification
        of the protocols used for nonpregnant women with suspicious palpable breast
        masses is required. This article reviews the challenges for physicians in
        making the diagnosis of breast cancer during pregnancy and upon diagnosis,
        counseling patients about treatment options. The consequences of diagnostic
        investigations and cancer treatment for the exposed fetus are also addressed.  Keywords:

        TN, USA  Abstract: More than 40% of all breast cancer cases are diagnosed
        in patients aged &ge;65 years, accounting for an ever-increasing disease burden
        in the elderly. Historically, however, this growing population of breast cancer
        patients has been underrepresented in clinical trials, resulting in a paucity
        of data that clinicians can reference in making treatment decisions for their
        older patients. A consequence may be the undertreatment of elderly patients,
        who have the highest incidence of breast cancer. However, subgroup analyses
        of elderly patients in multiple early-Phase (I or II) studies and a handful
        of small studies with elderly-specific populations have suggested that older
        patients may experience similar benefit from cancer therapy as younger patients
        with otherwise similar baseline characteristics. Although steps should be
        taken to avoid undertreating older patients, a balance must be achieved to
        avoid overtreatment. Guidelines have been released detailing recommendations
        for the treatment of elderly breast cancer patients, including a discussion
        of various geriatric assessments that might aid physicians in selecting patients
        appropriate for recommended treatment options. Chemotherapy remains a key
        component of treatment regimens for many older patients. However, the benefit
        of some agents may be limited by tolerability issues. Taxanes, one of the
        most established classes of chemotherapy for breast cancer, are known to be
        highly active and efficacious and to have well-characterized safety profiles.
        This review discusses factors that influence treatment choices for elderly
        patients with metastatic breast cancer, and then focuses on clinical data
        for taxanes in this patient population.  Keywords: breast cancer, elderly,

        At time of presentation, fewer than 10% of patients have metastatic breast
        cancer. The most common sites of metastasis in order of frequency are bone,
        lung, pleura, soft tissue, and liver. Breast cancer metastasis to the uterus
        or gallbladder is rare and has infrequently been reported in the English literature.\nPresentation
        of case: A 47 year old female with a recent history of thrombocytopenia presented
        with abnormal vaginal bleeding. Pelvic ultrasound revealed multiple uterine
        fibroids and endometrial curettings revealed cells consistent with lobular
        carcinoma of the breast. Breast examination revealed edema and induration
        of the lower half of the right breast. Biopsy of the right breast revealed
        invasive lobular carcinoma. Bone marrow aspiration obtained at a previous
        outpatient visit revealed extensive involvement by metastatic breast carcinoma.
        Shortly after discharge, the patient presented with acute cholecystitis and
        underwent cholecystectomy. Microscopic examination of the gallbladder revealed
        metastatic infiltrating lobular carcinoma. The final diagnosis was invasive
        lobular carcinoma of the right breast with metastasis to the bone marrow,
        endometrium, gallbladder, regional lymph nodes, and peritoneum.\nDiscussion:
        The growth pattern of invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast is unique and
        poses a challenge in diagnosing the cancer at an early stage. Unlike other
        types of breast cancer, it tends to metastasize more to the peritoneum, ovary,
        and gastrointestinal tract. Metastasis to the endometrium or gallbladder is
        rare.\nConclusion: Metastatic spread should be considered in the differential
        diagnosis of patients with invasive lobular breast carcinoma presenting with
        abnormal vaginal bleeding or acute cholecystitis.", "subject": [{"code": "RD1-811",

        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>Clinical relevance of tumor infiltrating
        lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer is controversial. Here, we used a tumor
        microarray including a large series of ductal and lobular breast cancers with
        long term follow up data, to analyze clinical impact of TIL expressing specific
        phenotypes and distribution of TILs within different tumor compartments and
        in different histological subtypes.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>A tissue microarray
        (TMA) including 894 ductal and 164 lobular breast cancers was stained with
        antibodies recognizing CD4, FOXP3, and IL-17 by standard immunohistochemical
        techniques. Lymphocyte counts were correlated with clinico-pathological parameters
        and survival.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>CD4<sup>+ </sup>lymphocytes were more
        prevalent than FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>TILs whereas IL-17<sup>+ </sup>TILs were
        rare. Increased numbers of total CD4<sup>+ </sup>and FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>TIL
        were observed in ductal, as compared with lobular carcinomas. High grade (G3)
        and estrogen receptor (ER) negative ductal carcinomas displayed significantly
        (<it>p </it> < 0.001) higher CD4<sup>+ </sup>and FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>lymphocyte
        infiltration while her2/neu over-expression in ductal carcinomas was significantly
        (<it>p </it> < 0.001) associated with higher FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>TIL counts.
        In contrast, lymphocyte infiltration was not linked to any clinico-pathological
        parameters in lobular cancers. In univariate but not in multivariate analysis
        CD4<sup>+ </sup>infiltration was associated with significantly shorter survival
        in patients bearing ductal, but not lobular cancers. However, a FOXP3<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+
        </sup>ratio > 1 was associated with improved overall survival even in multivariate
        analysis (<it>p </it>= 0.033).</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>Ductal and lobular
        breast cancers appear to be infiltrated by different lymphocyte subpopulations.
        In ductal cancers increased CD4<sup>+ </sup>and FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>TIL numbers
        are associated with more aggressive tumor features. In survival analysis,
        absolute numbers of TILs do not represent major prognostic indicators in ductal
        and lobular breast cancer. Remarkably however, a ratio > 1 of total FOXP3<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+
        </sup>TILs in ductal carcinoma appears to represent an independent favorable
        prognostic factor.</p> ", "subject": [{"code": "RC254-282", "term": "Neoplasms.

        PA, USA Abstract: Risk factors allow us to define women who are at increased
        lifetime risk for breast cancer, and the most important factor is age. Benign
        breast disease increases risk, and the most important histologies are atypical
        lobular or ductal hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ. Family history
        of breast cancer among first-degree relatives (mother, sisters, daughters)
        also increases risk. Quantitative measures of risk give accurate predictions
        of breast cancer incidence for groups of women but not for individual subjects.
        Multiple published, randomized controlled trials, which employed selective
        estrogen receptor (ER) modulators (SERMs), have demonstrated consistent reductions
        of 35% or greater in the risk of ER-positive invasive and noninvasive breast
        cancer in postmenopausal women. Professional organizations in the US now recommend
        the use of SERMs to reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk, postmenopausal
        women. Raloxifene and tamoxifen reduce the risk of ER-positive invasive breast
        cancer with equal efficacy, but raloxifene is associated with a lower risk
        of thromboembolic disease, benign uterine conditions, and cataracts than tamoxifen
        in postmenopausal women. No evidence exists establishing whether a reduction
        in breast cancer risk from either agent translates into reduced breast cancer
        mortality. Overall quality of life is similar with raloxifene or tamoxifen,
        but the incidence of dyspareunia, weight gain, and musculoskeletal complaints
        is higher with raloxifene use, whereas vasomotor symptoms, bladder incontinence,
        gynecologic symptoms, and leg cramps were higher with tamoxifen use. Keywords:

        c) receptor status of breast cancer and, d) survival in Indians/Pakistanis
        compared to Caucasians. There were 360,933 breast cancer cases diagnosed 1988-2006.
        Chi-Square analyses and Cox proportional hazards models, to estimate relative

        There should be high clinical suspicion of bowel metastasis in patients presenting
