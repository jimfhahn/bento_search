        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>The association between lobular breast
        cancer and family history is not clear. The aim of the study was to possibly
        identifying new hereditary patterns predisposing for cancer in the different
        histopathologic subtypes of breast cancer, with focus on patients with lobular
        breast cancer and cancer in their first degree relatives.</p> <p>Methods</p>
        <p>In 1676 consecutive breast cancer patients detailed family history of cancer
        was related to histopathologic subtype of breast cancer.</p> <p>Results</p>
        <p>Patients with lobular breast cancer were found to be significantly positively
        associated with having a father diagnosed with cancer, OR 2.17 (95% confidence
        interval (CI) 1.37-3.46). The finding persisted after excluding breast cancer
        in the family. Ductal breast cancer was associated with having a mother diagnosed
        with cancer. There was a significant association between lobular breast cancer
        and having a father with prostate cancer, OR 2.4 (CI 1.1-5.3). The occurrence
        of having a father with prostate cancer for lobular breast cancer patients
        was higher in the younger patient group, OR 2.9 (CI 1.1-7.8), and was still
        high but lost statistical significance in the older patient group, OR 1.9
        (CI 0.5-7.4). The association between lobular breast cancer and a father remained
        significant after excluding fathers with prostate cancer, OR 1.94 (CI 1.20-3.14).
        Other commonly occurring tumor types in the father included sarcoma and leukemia.</p>
        <p>Conclusion</p> <p>We propose that lobular breast cancer is associated with
        having a father diagnosed with cancer, most commonly prostate carcinoma. Since
        the association remained after excluding family history of breast cancer,
        the association seems independent of classical breast cancer heredity. The
        association with a father diagnosed with cancer also remained after removing
        prostate cancer, indicating an independence from prostate cancer as well.
        The reason for this association is genetically unclear, but could involve
        sex-specific imprinting.</p> ", "subject": [{"code": "RC254-282", "term":

        new molecular biology techniques, recent studies have implicated a common

        cell lesions. Our aims were to assess the frequency of lobular neoplasia in
        a series of breast biopsies that were performed and examined in the same institution
        and to analyze the association between subtypes of lobular neoplasia and benign
        and malignant breast lesions.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>Cases were selected after
        reviewing archived pathological reports in the Breast Pathology Laboratory,
        School of Medicine of Federal University of Minas Gerais (1999-2008). Cases
        of lobular neoplasia were reviewed and classified as atypical lobular hyperplasia,
        ductal involvement by cells of atypical lobular hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma
        <it>in situ</it>, and pleomorphic lobular carcinoma <it>in situ</it>. Coexistence
        of lobular neoplasia with other breast lesions, including columnar cell lesions,
        invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma, was evaluated. The
        association between lobular neoplasia and breast lesions was analyzed by Fisher''s
        exact test and chi-square test for linear trend.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>We
        analyzed 5650 breast specimens, selecting 135 breast specimens (2.4%) that
        had a diagnosis of lobular neoplasia, corresponding to 106 patients. Hematoxylin
        and eosin-stained slides were available for 84 cases, 5 of which were excluded
        because they contained only \"indeterminate\" <it>in situ </it>lesions. Of
        the 79 remaining cases, columnar cell lesions were present in 78.5%, primarily
        with columnar cell changes without atypia (67.7%). Invasive carcinoma was
        present in 45.6% of cases of lobular neoplasia--a similar frequency (47.2%)
        as invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma. We noted a significant
        linear trend (p < 0.03) of a higher frequency of invasive carcinomas that
        were concomitant with lobular carcinoma <it>in situ </it>compared with atypical
        lobular hyperplasia. Invasive lobular carcinomas were associated with lobular
        carcinoma <it>in situ </it>in 33% of cases, compared with 2.8% of atypical
        lobular hyperplasia cases.</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>Our findings confirm
        a frequent association between lobular neoplasia and columnar cell lesions,
        the majority of which lacked atypia. We also observed a greater frequency
        of invasive carcinoma, more commonly invasive lobular carcinoma, associated
        with more developed forms of lobular neoplasia (lobular carcinoma <it>in situ</it>).</p>

        Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,
        Cooper University Hospital, Camden, NJ, USA  Abstract: Cancer is diagnosed
        approximately once per 1,000 pregnancies; most commonly due to the reproductive
        age of the women, these include breast, cervical, melanoma, thyroid, and Hodgkin&#39;s
        lymphoma diagnoses. As a single diagnosis, breast cancer is the most common
        cancer diagnosed during pregnancy. Cancer is expected to complicate pregnancy
        more often due to the trend for women to delay child bearing to later maternal
        ages. Delayed first birth is itself a risk factor for breast cancer. Termination
        of pregnancy has not been shown to afford a survival benefit. While protecting
        the interests of mother and unborn fetus, breast cancer can be safely diagnosed,
        staged, and treated during pregnancy with good outcomes for both. Some modification
        of the protocols used for nonpregnant women with suspicious palpable breast
        masses is required. This article reviews the challenges for physicians in
        making the diagnosis of breast cancer during pregnancy and upon diagnosis,
        counseling patients about treatment options. The consequences of diagnostic
        investigations and cancer treatment for the exposed fetus are also addressed.  Keywords:

        TN, USA  Abstract: More than 40% of all breast cancer cases are diagnosed
        in patients aged &ge;65 years, accounting for an ever-increasing disease burden
        in the elderly. Historically, however, this growing population of breast cancer
        patients has been underrepresented in clinical trials, resulting in a paucity
        of data that clinicians can reference in making treatment decisions for their
        older patients. A consequence may be the undertreatment of elderly patients,
        who have the highest incidence of breast cancer. However, subgroup analyses
        of elderly patients in multiple early-Phase (I or II) studies and a handful
        of small studies with elderly-specific populations have suggested that older
        patients may experience similar benefit from cancer therapy as younger patients
        with otherwise similar baseline characteristics. Although steps should be
        taken to avoid undertreating older patients, a balance must be achieved to
        avoid overtreatment. Guidelines have been released detailing recommendations
        for the treatment of elderly breast cancer patients, including a discussion
        of various geriatric assessments that might aid physicians in selecting patients
        appropriate for recommended treatment options. Chemotherapy remains a key
        component of treatment regimens for many older patients. However, the benefit
        of some agents may be limited by tolerability issues. Taxanes, one of the
        most established classes of chemotherapy for breast cancer, are known to be
        highly active and efficacious and to have well-characterized safety profiles.
        This review discusses factors that influence treatment choices for elderly
        patients with metastatic breast cancer, and then focuses on clinical data
        for taxanes in this patient population.  Keywords: breast cancer, elderly,

        At time of presentation, fewer than 10% of patients have metastatic breast
        cancer. The most common sites of metastasis in order of frequency are bone,
        lung, pleura, soft tissue, and liver. Breast cancer metastasis to the uterus
        or gallbladder is rare and has infrequently been reported in the English literature.\nPresentation
        of case: A 47 year old female with a recent history of thrombocytopenia presented
        with abnormal vaginal bleeding. Pelvic ultrasound revealed multiple uterine
        fibroids and endometrial curettings revealed cells consistent with lobular
        carcinoma of the breast. Breast examination revealed edema and induration
        of the lower half of the right breast. Biopsy of the right breast revealed
        invasive lobular carcinoma. Bone marrow aspiration obtained at a previous
        outpatient visit revealed extensive involvement by metastatic breast carcinoma.
        Shortly after discharge, the patient presented with acute cholecystitis and
        underwent cholecystectomy. Microscopic examination of the gallbladder revealed
        metastatic infiltrating lobular carcinoma. The final diagnosis was invasive
        lobular carcinoma of the right breast with metastasis to the bone marrow,
        endometrium, gallbladder, regional lymph nodes, and peritoneum.\nDiscussion:
        The growth pattern of invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast is unique and
        poses a challenge in diagnosing the cancer at an early stage. Unlike other
        types of breast cancer, it tends to metastasize more to the peritoneum, ovary,
        and gastrointestinal tract. Metastasis to the endometrium or gallbladder is
        rare.\nConclusion: Metastatic spread should be considered in the differential
        diagnosis of patients with invasive lobular breast carcinoma presenting with
        abnormal vaginal bleeding or acute cholecystitis.", "subject": [{"code": "RD1-811",

        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>Clinical relevance of tumor infiltrating
        lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer is controversial. Here, we used a tumor
        microarray including a large series of ductal and lobular breast cancers with
        long term follow up data, to analyze clinical impact of TIL expressing specific
        phenotypes and distribution of TILs within different tumor compartments and
        in different histological subtypes.</p> <p>Methods</p> <p>A tissue microarray
        (TMA) including 894 ductal and 164 lobular breast cancers was stained with
        antibodies recognizing CD4, FOXP3, and IL-17 by standard immunohistochemical
        techniques. Lymphocyte counts were correlated with clinico-pathological parameters
        and survival.</p> <p>Results</p> <p>CD4<sup>+ </sup>lymphocytes were more
        prevalent than FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>TILs whereas IL-17<sup>+ </sup>TILs were
        rare. Increased numbers of total CD4<sup>+ </sup>and FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>TIL
        were observed in ductal, as compared with lobular carcinomas. High grade (G3)
        and estrogen receptor (ER) negative ductal carcinomas displayed significantly
        (<it>p </it> < 0.001) higher CD4<sup>+ </sup>and FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>lymphocyte
        infiltration while her2/neu over-expression in ductal carcinomas was significantly
        (<it>p </it> < 0.001) associated with higher FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>TIL counts.
        In contrast, lymphocyte infiltration was not linked to any clinico-pathological
        parameters in lobular cancers. In univariate but not in multivariate analysis
        CD4<sup>+ </sup>infiltration was associated with significantly shorter survival
        in patients bearing ductal, but not lobular cancers. However, a FOXP3<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+
        </sup>ratio > 1 was associated with improved overall survival even in multivariate
        analysis (<it>p </it>= 0.033).</p> <p>Conclusions</p> <p>Ductal and lobular
        breast cancers appear to be infiltrated by different lymphocyte subpopulations.
        In ductal cancers increased CD4<sup>+ </sup>and FOXP3<sup>+ </sup>TIL numbers
        are associated with more aggressive tumor features. In survival analysis,
        absolute numbers of TILs do not represent major prognostic indicators in ductal
        and lobular breast cancer. Remarkably however, a ratio > 1 of total FOXP3<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+
        </sup>TILs in ductal carcinoma appears to represent an independent favorable
        prognostic factor.</p> ", "subject": [{"code": "RC254-282", "term": "Neoplasms.

        PA, USA Abstract: Risk factors allow us to define women who are at increased
        lifetime risk for breast cancer, and the most important factor is age. Benign
        breast disease increases risk, and the most important histologies are atypical
        lobular or ductal hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ. Family history
        of breast cancer among first-degree relatives (mother, sisters, daughters)
        also increases risk. Quantitative measures of risk give accurate predictions
        of breast cancer incidence for groups of women but not for individual subjects.
        Multiple published, randomized controlled trials, which employed selective
        estrogen receptor (ER) modulators (SERMs), have demonstrated consistent reductions
        of 35% or greater in the risk of ER-positive invasive and noninvasive breast
        cancer in postmenopausal women. Professional organizations in the US now recommend
        the use of SERMs to reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk, postmenopausal
        women. Raloxifene and tamoxifen reduce the risk of ER-positive invasive breast
        cancer with equal efficacy, but raloxifene is associated with a lower risk
        of thromboembolic disease, benign uterine conditions, and cataracts than tamoxifen
        in postmenopausal women. No evidence exists establishing whether a reduction
        in breast cancer risk from either agent translates into reduced breast cancer
        mortality. Overall quality of life is similar with raloxifene or tamoxifen,
        but the incidence of dyspareunia, weight gain, and musculoskeletal complaints
        is higher with raloxifene use, whereas vasomotor symptoms, bladder incontinence,
        gynecologic symptoms, and leg cramps were higher with tamoxifen use. Keywords:
