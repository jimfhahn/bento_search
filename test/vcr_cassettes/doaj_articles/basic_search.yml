        "<p>Abstract</p> <p>Background</p> <p>The association between lobular breast
        cancer and family history is not clear. The aim of the study was to possibly
        identifying new hereditary patterns predisposing for cancer in the different
        histopathologic subtypes of breast cancer, with focus on patients with lobular
        breast cancer and cancer in their first degree relatives.</p> <p>Methods</p>
        <p>In 1676 consecutive breast cancer patients detailed family history of cancer
        was related to histopathologic subtype of breast cancer.</p> <p>Results</p>
        <p>Patients with lobular breast cancer were found to be significantly positively
        associated with having a father diagnosed with cancer, OR 2.17 (95% confidence
        interval (CI) 1.37-3.46). The finding persisted after excluding breast cancer
        in the family. Ductal breast cancer was associated with having a mother diagnosed
        with cancer. There was a significant association between lobular breast cancer
        and having a father with prostate cancer, OR 2.4 (CI 1.1-5.3). The occurrence
        of having a father with prostate cancer for lobular breast cancer patients
        was higher in the younger patient group, OR 2.9 (CI 1.1-7.8), and was still
        high but lost statistical significance in the older patient group, OR 1.9
        (CI 0.5-7.4). The association between lobular breast cancer and a father remained
        significant after excluding fathers with prostate cancer, OR 1.94 (CI 1.20-3.14).
        Other commonly occurring tumor types in the father included sarcoma and leukemia.</p>
        <p>Conclusion</p> <p>We propose that lobular breast cancer is associated with
        having a father diagnosed with cancer, most commonly prostate carcinoma. Since
        the association remained after excluding family history of breast cancer,
        the association seems independent of classical breast cancer heredity. The
        association with a father diagnosed with cancer also remained after removing
        prostate cancer, indicating an independence from prostate cancer as well.
        The reason for this association is genetically unclear, but could involve
        sex-specific imprinting.</p> ", "subject": [{"code": "RC254-282", "term":
