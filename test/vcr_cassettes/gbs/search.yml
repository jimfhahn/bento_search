            "description": "From the breast health experts at Mayo Clinic comes a guide to the many aspects of breast cancer—from prevention, to care and coping, to survival, to living with hope. Trustworthy information offered in a spirit of companionship. “This is the best source for readable, up-to-date information—from the world’s experts.” —Dr. Thomas J. Smith, Johns Hopkins Hospital “If you’re looking for a comprehensive, easy-to-read book about an often confusing topic, The Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer Book is for you.” —Henry M. Kuerer, M.D., Ph.D., FACS, Professor and Director, Breast Surgical Oncology Training Program, MD Anderson Cancer Center “Readers will likely return again and again to this book as a convenient source of knowledge, insight, and reassurance as they confront the many decisions required in the treatment of breast cancer.” —Clifford A. Hudis, M.D., Chief, Breast Cancer Medicine Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Mayo Clinic Cancer Center is dedicated to understanding and discovering new ways to predict, prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, transforming the quality of life for cancer patients today and into the future. With a multisite national presence, its three campuses—in Pheonix/Scottsdale, Ariz.; Jacksonville, Fla.; and Rochester, Minn.—offer a broad geographic reach to serve patients. Designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center is a leader in translating discoveries into effective improvements in patient care. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Mayo Clinic took root in farm fields near Rochester, Minn., in the late 1800s. It grew from the medical practice of a country doctor, William Worrall Mayo, and the partnership of his two sons, William J. and Charles H. Mayo—affectionately known as Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie. The brothers' innovative ideas and tireless work in learning and creating new surgical techniques attracted international attention. Physicians from around the world came to watch the Mayo brothers perform surgery. The Mayo brothers invited other doctors to join them, forming teams of medical experts. Today, Mayo Clinic—one of the world’s oldest and largest multispecialty group practices—comprises more than 45,000 physicians, scientists, nurses and other staff at its three locations in Rochester, Minn., Jacksonville, Fla., and Scottsdale, Ariz., and its regional community-based health care practices.",

Now, a new edition addresses current developments in cancer research and offers more tips on how people living with cancer can fight it and how healthy people can prevent it. The new edition of Anticancer includes: • The latest research on anticancer foods, including new alternatives to sugar and cautions about some that are now on the market • New information about how vitamin D strengthens the immune system • Warnings about common food contaminants that have recently been proven to contribute to cancer progression • A new chapter on mind-body approaches to stress reduction, with recent studies that show how our reactions to stress can interfere with natural defenses and how friendships can support healing in ways never before understood • A groundbreaking study showing that lifestyle modification, as originally proposed in Anticancer, reduces mortality for breast cancer by an astounding 68 percent after completion of treatment • New supporting evidence for the entire Anticancer program",

Why, for example, have women always had such a raw deal in the cancer stakes? And why are some cancers, such as prostate cancer, increasing in incidence? Greaves argues that Darwinian selection millions of years ago has endowed our genes and cells with inherently cancerous credentials, and this is exacerbated by our rapid social evolution and exotic behavioural traits that outpace genetic adaptation. The book is full of novel insights, the latest scientific discoveries, and wonderful historical anecdotes. It provides a unique portrait of cancer, past, present, and future.",
