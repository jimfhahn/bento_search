        crystals of new N-benzylideneaniline derivatives as potential materials for
        non-linear optics</title>\r\n<link>http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?ao5005</link>\r\n<description>Three
        new N-benzylideneaniline derivatives [p-nitrobenzylidene-p-phenylamineaniline
        (I), 2,4-dinitrobenzylidene-p-phenylamineaniline (II) and p-dinitrobenzylidene-p-diethylamineaniline
        (III)] containing electron&#x2013;push&#x2013;pull groups have been prepared.
        They present a planar N-benzylideneaniline core and neighbouring functional
        atoms, which are related through an efficient intramolecular charge transfer
        (CT). Two of the derivatives crystallize in non-centrosymmetric space groups,
        a necessary condition for non-linear optical (NLO) responses. The NLO properties
        were calculated for the molecular conformations determined by single-crystal
        X-ray diffraction as well as for the four molecules packed into each corresponding
        unit cell, using a quantum-chemical method at the cam-B3LYP/NLO-V level of
        theory. As expected from antiparallel face-to-face stacking through centrosymmetry,
        the main NLO descriptors &#x2013; namely, the first hyperpolarizability (&#x3B2;tot)
        and its projection on the dipole moment direction (&#x3B2;vec) &#x2013; are
        almost zero for the tetramer of derivative III. Interestingly, the calculated
        first hyperpolarizability decreases in the non-centrosymmetric unit-cell content
        of derivative II when compared to its single molecule, which may be related
        to its molecular pillaring, similar to that observed in derivative III. On
        the other hand, a desirable magnification of the NLO properties was found
        for packed units of derivative I, which may be a consequence of its parallel
        face-to-tail stacking with the CT vectors of all molecules pointing in the
        same direction. Moreover, the CT vector of compound I makes an angle of &#x3B8;
        = 33.6&#xB0; with its crystal polar axis, resulting in a higher-order parameter
        (cos3&#x3B8; = 0.6) compared with the other derivatives. This is in line with
        the higher macroscopic second-order NLO response predicted for derivative

        novel analytical approach is proposed for the characterization of organic
        molecular crystal structures where close packing is an important factor. It
        requires the identification of a unique reference axis within the crystal,
        along which three-dimensional space is divided into close-packed blocks (CPB)
        and junction zones (JZ). The degree of close packing along the reference axis
        is quantified by a two-dimensional packing function, &#x3D5;2D, of symmetry
        determined by the space group. Values of &#x3D5;2D reflect the degree of area-filling
        in planes perpendicular to this axis. The requirement of close packing within
        CPB allows the planar structures perpendicular to the reference axis to be
        analysed as tessellations of area-filling molecular-based cells (MBC), which
        are generally hexagonal. The form of these cells reflects the molecular shape
        in the cross-section, since their vertices are given by the centres of the
        voids between molecules. There are two basic types of MBC, Type 1, of glide
        or pseudo-glide symmetry, and Type 2, which is formed by lattice translations
        alone and generally requires a short unit-cell axis. MBC at layers of special
        symmetry are used to characterize the structures in terms of equivalent ellipses
        with parameters aell, bell and &#x3C7;ell. The ratio aell/bell allows the
        established &#x3B1;, &#x3B2;, &#x3B3; classification to be integrated into

        all the structures considered, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), substituted
        anthracenes and anthraquinones (SAA) and 2-benzyl-5-benzylidene (BBCP) are
        mapped onto a universal curve. The division of three-dimensional space into
        CPB and JZ is fundamentally useful for crystal engineering, since the structural
        perturbations brought about by substitution at hydrogen positions located
        within JZ are minimal. A contribution is also made to ongoing debate concerning
        the adoption of polar space groups, isomorphism and polymorphism.</description>\r\n<dc:identifier>DOI

        (NH4)3WO2F5 = (NH4)3[WO2F4]F have been synthesized by solid-state reaction
        or from fluoride solution and its crystal structures at 296 and 193&#x2005;K
        were determined by X-ray diffraction. At room temperature, the crystal structure
        of the compound is dynamically disordered with the ligand atoms statistically
        distributed on two positions (6e and 24m) of the Pm3m unit cell [a = 6.0298&#x2005;(1)&#x2005;&#xC5;],
        and the tungsten atom dynamically disordered on 12 orientations forming a
        spatial cuboctahedron [W12] that enables the real geometry of cis-WO2F4 octahedron
        to be determined with two short W&#x2014;O distances. On cooling, the compound
        undergoes a first-order phase transition with the symmetry change Pm3m &#x2192;
        Pa3 and a doubling of the unit-cell parameter [a = 11.9635&#x2005;(7)&#x2005;&#xC5;].
        The ligand F(O) atoms statistically occupy two general 24d sites and form
        W1X6 and W2X6 octahedra, in which the O and F atoms are not crystallographically
        different that means a static orientational disorder of (NH4)3WO2F5.</p>]]></content:encoded>\r\n</item>\n<item
